He was elected to Congress in 2012 and advocated for congressional term limits and a balanced budget amendment. He also spearheaded oversight efforts to expose malfeasance in the IRS and in agencies involved in abusing their authority during the manufacturing of the Russia collusion conspiracy theory. Congressman DeSantis was also a leading champion for America’s veterans and helped enact reforms to the VA and place an emphasis on mental health.

        <br/>
      </div>
      <div id="icidh" class="text">As Florida’s 44th Governor from 2007 to 2011, Charlie Crist led Florida through the Great Recession and the Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill, always keeping his word to fight for the people. He helped lower the cost of doing business and living in Florida, increase transparency in government, strengthen Florida’s economy and ensure the safety and world-class education of Florida’s children. Today, as the Congressman from Florida’s 13th District, Charlie Crist fights to create opportunities so every Floridian can thrive. In 2016, Charlie flipped a Republican seat and won election to Congress. Since then, he has built a record of working across the aisle to make meaningful change for Florida families.
      </div>
      <div id="reas" class="text">Reasoning: Ron DeSantis&#039; transphobic attacks have made him dangerous for those in the LBGTQ+ community and the families who support them. While Charlie Crist was the least interesting candidate of the primaries, his running mate, Karla Hernandez, offers a bold new perspective not seen in Florida. Will surely be an improvement over the current incumbent.
