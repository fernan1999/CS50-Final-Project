      </div>
      <div title="1st Candidate" class="text" id="ig9to">At a time when Washington, D.C. faces so much partisan division and dysfunction, year after year Senator Marco Rubio delivers real results for Florida and the country. From the Paycheck Protection Program and the expanded Child Tax Credit to critical veterans reform and Everglades restoration, Senator Rubio gets results. A non-partisan analysis produced by GovTrack ranked Senator Rubio as the second top leader compared to all Senators in 2019. The same analysis found he was the fourth top leader in 2018 and fifth top leader in 2017. One of Senator Rubio’s highest priorities is ensuring he and his staff are available to help Floridians with whatever federal assistance they may need. In 2019, the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF) recognized Senator Rubio’s federal casework team as the best in the nation by honoring the office with the “Democracy Award for Excellence in Constituent Services.”

      <div title="2nd C name" id="ihsjj">Val Demings (DEM)
      </div>
      <div title="2nd Candidate" class="text" id="i47rk">Chief Demings served 27 years and at every ranking level in the Orlando Police Department. She commanded the Special Operations division and handled the department’s highest-profile tasks. She coordinated the response of the Airport Division on 9/11. And in 2007, she made history when she was appointed to serve as the city’s first female Chief of Police. The eyes of the city were on her. The financial crisis was squeezing budgets. But by taking the tough fights head-on, she did more with less, kept officers on the street, and crushed violent crime, reducing it by 40%. In 2016, Chief Demings was elected by the voters of Florida’s 10th District to serve in Congress. She swiftly gained a reputation as a tireless champion for public safety, civil rights, and the American Dream that had given her a chance to succeed. She gained widespread acclaim for her conduct as a deliberative and justice-focused impeachment manager during the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.
      </div>
      <div title="Reasoning" class="text" id="in6q1">Reasoning: Val Demings is a very qualified candidate with a proven track record that, despite our support for the ACAB movement, has the best chance at beating the incumbent in a right leaning state such as Florida. Purely partisan support, a moral recommendation would be Dennis Misigoy who recognizes and better stands against the threat of police violence in this country, especially towards minorities.

      <div title="3rd C name" id="i119z">Dennis Misigoy (LPF)
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div title="3rd Candidate" class="text" id="i4ybr">In the November 2016 general election, Dennis was elected to Seat 1 on the Board of Supervisors for the Enclave at Black Point Community Development District, a special taxing district in Miami-Dade County. For the first two years of his term, he faced an uphill battle as the sole voice of community residents opposed to wasteful spending projects supported by other members of the board and consistently on the losing side of 4-1 votes on all contentious issues. But his leadership was able to mobilize enough support in the community to change the board during the midterm elections, after which he led the board in saving the community over 78% of the funds which had been allotted to the unpopular projects and moving their public meetings to a time and place reasonably accessible to working members of the community. Throughout the remainder of his term in office, Dennis was a consistent voice of reason, successfully standing up for the concerns of the community when the board considered proposed projects opposed by those who would be most affected.
